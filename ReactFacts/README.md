# ReactFacts - The Initial Project

This is an exercise for me to practice what I've learned from the first section.
An improvement of the simple static page displaying the facts about React. 
I rebuilt everything from scratch to better remember and apply the concepts I've learned.

## To see the page

Make sure your terminal is in the ReactFacts folder (you can do that by typing 'cd ./ReactFacts/' in your terminal).
Then run the command 'npm run dev' and access it through your localhost site

## Current problem

I cannot set how body/main element to fill the screen of my device, so even
though the width of main is 100%, it could only take up 50% of my screen.
That is why the React icon is hanging like that, it is supposed to be
hanging around the right side of the website.
